## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your
## functions do

## The function "makeCacheMatrix" calculates the inverse of a matrix x.



makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## The function "cacheSolve" checks if the inverse has been calculated.
## If the inverse was already calculated: the inverse from the cache will be 
## presented computation. When the inverse can not be found in the cache, 
## the function will calculates the inverse of the matrix. 

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
